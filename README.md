# MLB-The-Show-Recommender
## Description
MLB the Show is the offically licensed baseball video game franchise. The most popular game mode is 'Diamond Dynasty' aka DD. In DD players collect player cards, modeled after the popular hobby of baseball card collecting, in effort to build their ideal team. Players can be current or former players. The purpose of this project is to create a recommender system that will recommend players to add to your squad based on players that you like playing with it. I will be updating this README as time goes on but ideally the full functionality of this project will result in a application (complete with a UI) that allows you to build a lineup around your core, favorite player cards.
